"Platform documentation" contains the documentation of the C++ 
part of the platform ( which is used by the IDE ) : Open index.html.
"Runtime documentation" contains the documentation of the Javascript

You need to have Doxygen ( www.doxygen.org ) 
and YUIdoc ( http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/ ).

To generate the platform documentation, just go in this folder
with a terminal, type "doxygen" and press Enter.

To generate the runtime documentation, go in this folder with
a terminal, type "yuidoc ../Runtime" and press Enter.
