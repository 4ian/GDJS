How to generate the documentation
---------------------------------

You need to have Doxygen (www.doxygen.org)
and YUIdoc (http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/).

To generate the platform documentation, just go in this folder
with a terminal, type "doxygen" and press Enter.

To generate the runtime documentation, go in this folder with
a terminal, type "yuidoc" and press Enter.
