 * \section welcome Welcome
 * This is the help file for the Game Develop JS Platform, which contains a reference of all the features provided
 * by the JS Platform and explains how to create <b>extensions</b> for this platform.<br>
 * Writing extensions requires to know Javascript and you need to write a bit of C++ code: Do not worry, everything is explained
 * here.
 *
 * ### Game engine documentation
 * Note that the documentation of the Javascript game engine of this platform is available [here](../Runtime documentation/index.html).
 *
 * ### Game Develop Core documentation
 * Some classes and features are provided by the *Game Develop Core Library* : Read [this page](\ref AboutGDCore) to get a quick introduction
 * to this library, or read the [full documentation here](..\..\..\Core\doc\Documentation\index.html).
 *
 * \section gettingstarted Getting started
 * First, please refer to these pages to install the required tools and to get help about setting up a basic extension:<br>

/**
 * \page setupDevEnv Setting up the development environnement
 *
 * Modifying the Game Develop JS Runtime ( The game engine written in Javascript ) does not require
 * any particular setup but you need to have a development environment for compiling the C++ part of
 * the extension and/or of the JS platform:
 *
 * <b>Windows</b>
 *
 * Follow these three step:
 * -# \subpage downloadGDSDK
 * -# \subpage installWinLibs
 * -# \subpage installWinCompiler

/**
 * \page downloadGDSDK Download the Game Develop SDK
 *
 * To work or develop an extension for the JS Platform, you need to have the Game Develop SDK:<br>
 * If it is not already done, just go on http://www.compilgames.net and download the SDK.
 *
 * Then, extract it somewhere and put the <b>GDJS</b> folder inside the Game Develop SDK folder.
 *
 * If you want to work on official extensions, they are not directly shipped with the SDK, but
 * are available on https://github.com/4ian/gd-extensions
 */

/**
 *  \page installWinLibs (Windows) Download and install SFML, wxWidgets and Boost
 *
 * %Game Develop uses development versions of SFML, wxWidgets or Boost. So as to prevent incompatibilities between the core of %Game Develop and
 * the extensions, %Game Develop require the extensions to use the same version of the libraries.
 * \section download Download

 * You can download the specific versions of the libraries used by the current version of %Game Develop using these links:<br>
 * - http://www.compilgames.net/code/GameDevelopSDK/SFML.7z
 * - http://www.compilgames.net/code/GameDevelopSDK/wxwidgets.7z
 * - http://www.compilgames.net/code/GameDevelopSDK/boost_1_46_1.7z
 *
 * They are already built for windows, and for an use with the TDM-GCC compiler.
 *
 * \section uncompress Uncompress
 * By default, %Game Develop projects search the libraries in the ExtLibs
 * ( located at the root of the SDK ) directory ( ExtLibs/SFML, ExtLibs/wxWidgets... ).<br>
 * Uncompress the libraries in this directory.
 */

/**
 *  \page installWinCompiler (Windows) Install TDM-GCC compiler
 *
 * %Game Develop is compiled with TDM-GCC under Windows.<br>
 * So as to prevent incompatibilities between the compiler ( and the standard C++ library provided with ) used by %Game Develop and
 * the compiler used by the extensions, %Game Develop require the extensions and the platforms to use the same version of TDM-GCC.<br>
 *
 * \section installWinCompiler_download Download
 *
 * The current version of the compiler used by %Game Develop can be found and downloaded on the website : http://www.compilgames.net
 *
 * \section installWinCompiler_install Installation
 *
 * The installation is fairly simple :<br>
 * <br>
 * - Launch the installer.<br>
 * - Choose Create.<br>

 \image html images/compilerInstall1.png

 * - Choose an installation directory.<br>

 \image html images/compilerInstall2.png

 * - Choose the components to be installed. You don't have to change anything, the default options are good enough.<br>

 \image html images/compilerInstall3.png

 * - Click on install so as to launch the installation process.<br>
 */

/**
 *  \page installAndUseCMake (All) Install and use Cmake
 *
 * Building is done using CMake: It is an open-source build system that can generate build files for lots of IDE and build tools ( Makefiles... ).
 *
 * \section installAndUseCMake_download Download and install CMake
 *
 * First, install CMake: <br>
 * Download it [here](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) or get it using your package manager if you're
 * using a Linux distribution.
 *
 * \section installAndUseCMake_use Using CMake to generate the build files
 *
 * \subsection installAndUseCMake_use_gui Using the GUI
 *
 * - Start the CMake user interface ( _cmake-gui_ ). Choose the GDSDK directory as the source directory, and Binaries/.build as the directory where to build the binaries:

 \image html images/usecmake1.png

 * - Click on *Configure*. If asked to create the build directory, answer yes. Choose then your favorite generator: *MinGW Makefiles* (on Windows) or *Unix Makefiles* (on Linux) generate a traditional Makefile that can be built using the
 * *mingw32-make* ( on Windows) or *make* ( on Linux ) command. You can also choose the *Ninja* generator to use the [Ninja build system](http://martine.github.io/ninja/).

  \image html images/usecmake2.png

 * - When you click on Finish, CMake do a first configuration. Adjust any variable if necessary ( no changes is needed by default ), then click on Generate.

  \image html images/usecmake3.png

 * - You can then launch a terminal/command prompt, go to the *.build* folder ( `cd SDKFolder/Binaries/.build` ) and launch the build 
 * using the generator you've choosen: `mingw32-make`, or `make` on Linux.
 *
 * Binaries are created into *Binaries/Output/Release* folder.
 * 
 * \subsection installAndUseCMake_use_cmd Using the command line
 *
 * Using the commandline with CMake is also easy:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * cd SDKFolder/Binaries
 * mkdir .build
 * cd .build
 * cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
 * mingw32-make
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * or using the fast [Ninja build system](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) :
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * cd SDKFolder/Binaries
 * mkdir .build
 * cd .build
 * cmake .. -G "Ninja"
 * ninja
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Binaries are of course also created into *Binaries/Output/Release* folder.<br>
 * ( For linux, this is the directory where you put the files of Game Develop )

/**
 * \page SDKDirectoriesStructure About SDK directories structure
 *
 * The SDK is composed of some directories :<br>

 * - GDCpp contains the headers of %Game Develop C++ Platform.
 * - IDE is the directory where the binaries of the extensions and the platforms are built.
 * - Runtime is a directory for binaries of the C++ Platform.
 * - Extensions contains the extensions. SDK provides the officials and open sources extensions of %Game Develop.
 *
 * \section filestructure Structure of an extension
 *
 * Each extension has its own directory, which is most of the time located itself in the <i>Extensions</i> folder.<br>
 * <br>
 * Basically, an extension is composed of a <i>JsExtension.cpp</i> file, which contains the information about the extension.<br>
 * One or more <i>.js</i> file contains the javascript code associated to the extension.
 *
 * Some others files may be present, like <i>Extension.cpp</i> and some <i>*.h</i> or <i>*.cpp</i> files when the extension is
 * compatible with the Game Develop JS Platform.
 */

/**
 * \page AboutExtensionJs About ExtensionJs.cpp
 *
 * An extension has to define ( Usually in a file called ExtensionJs.cpp for the JS Platform )
 * a class that is derived from the ExtensionBase class. This class contains, in its constructor, the declarations
 * of everything that is provided by the extension.

 * \section extensionDeclaration Declaring the extension information

 * The declarations are made using the methods provided by gd::PlatformExtension ( ExtensionBase is itself a subclass of gd::PlatformExtension,
 * provided by Game Develop Core. See the Game Develop Core documentation if you need more information ).
 *
 * The first declaration if often the information about the extension :

 * \code
    Extension()
    {
            SetExtensionInformation("TextObject",
                                  _("Text object"),
                                  _("Extension allowing to use an object displaying a text."),
                                  "Florian Rival",
                                  "zlib/libpng License ( Open Source )");
 * \endcode

The first parameter is the name of the extension. Choose carefully the name of the extension, as projects are directly referring to it.

 * \section instructionsDeclaration Declaring actions, conditions and expressions

Actions are declared like this :

 * \code
            AddAction("Name",
                           _("Name displayed to users"),
                           _("Description"),
                           _("Sentence displayed in event editor"),
                           _("Category"),
                           "path-to-an-24-by-24-icon-file.png",
                           "path-to-an-16-by-16-icon-file.png")
                .AddParameter("theTypeOfTheParameter", _("Parameter1"))
                .AddParameter("theTypeOfTheParameter", _("Parameter2"))
                .codeExtraInformation.SetFunctionName("myFunctionName").SetIncludeFile("MyExtension/MyIncludeFile.js");

 * \endcode
 * Declare conditions and expressions in a similar way.<br>
 * Parameters are added using gd::InstructionMetadata::AddParameter. See the function documentation for more information ( In the Game Develop Core documentation ).<br>
 * See also gd::InstructionMetadata::ExtraInformation class documentation for more information about SetFunctionName and similar functions.<br>
 *
 *
 * \section objectsDeclaration Declaring objects
 *
 * When declaring an object, extensions must provide two classes: A class deriving from gd::Object, which is the object that will be used
 * for storage and at edittime, and another class deriving from RuntimeObject, which will be used by the game engine.<br>
 * Objects are declared like this :
 *
 * \code
        gd::ObjectMetadata & obj = AddObject("Name",
                           _("Name displayed to users"),
                           _("Description"),
                           "path-to-an-32-by-32-icon.png",
                           &FunctionForCreatingTheObject,
                           &FunctionForDestroyingTheObject);
 * \endcode
 *
 * "FunctionForCreatingTheObject" and "FunctionForDestroyingTheObject" are two functions that must be provided with the object,
 * the first one to create a new instance of the object and the second to delete an object instance. See implementation example in TextObject extension.<br>
 *
 * You can then declare the actions, conditions, and expressions related to the objects, using the AddAction/AddCondition/AddExpression methods provided
 * by <i>obj</i>.
 * You will also want to specify where the object is located using gd::ObjectMetadata::SetIncludeFile. For example:
* \code
obj.SetIncludeFile("TextObject/runtimetextobject.js");
* \endcode

 * \section eventsDeclaration Declaring events
 *
 * Events are declared like this :
 * \code
    AddEvent("Name",
                  _("Name displayed to users"),
                  "Description",
                  "Group",
                  "path-to-a-16-by-16-icon.png",
                  boost::shared_ptr<gd::BaseEvent>(new EventClassName))
 * \endcode
 *
 * The event must be able to generate the code when events are being translated to C++:<br>
 * This is done by calling SetCodeGenerator. For example:
 *
 * \code
        AddEvent("Standard",
                  _("Standard event"),
                  _("Standard event: Actions are run if conditions are fulfilled."),
                  "",
                  "res/eventaddicon.png",
                  boost::shared_ptr<gd::BaseEvent>(new gd::StandardEvent))
                  .SetCodeGenerator(boost::shared_ptr<gd::EventMetadata::CodeGenerator>(codeGen));
 * \endcode

 * \section automatismsDeclaration Declaring the automatisms

Automatisms are declared like objects:


 * \code
        gd::AutomatismMetadata & aut = AddAutomatism("Name",
                          _("Name displayed to users"),
                          _("DefaultNameUsedInEditor"),
                          _("Description."),
                          "Group",
                          "path-to-a-32-by-32-icon.png",
                          "AutomatismClassName", //This has no importance for the JS platform.
                          boost::shared_ptr<gd::Automatism>(new AutomatismClassName),
                          boost::shared_ptr<gd::AutomatismsSharedData>(new AutomatismSharedDataClassName));
 * \endcode
 * ( The last line can be replaced by boost::shared_ptr<gd::AutomatismsSharedData>() if no shared data are being used ).<br>
 * <br>
 * You can then declare the actions, conditions, and expressions related to the automatism like objects:<br>
 * Call AddAction/AddCondition/AddExpression on the <i>aut</i> object.

 * \section example Here is an example of the skeleton of an extension:
 * \code
class JsExtension : public gd::PlatformExtension
{
public:
    JsExtension()
    {
        SetExtensionInformation("MyExtension",
                              _("Extension name"),
                              _("Extension declaration"),
                              "Author",
                              "license");

        AddAction(...);
        AddCondition(...);
        AddExpression(...);

        {
            gd::ObjectMetadata & obj = AddObject("ObjectName",
                       _("Object name"),
                       _("Description"),
                       "JsPlatform/Extensions/myicon.png",
                       &CreateMyObject,
                       &DestroyMyObject,
                       "ObjectClassName");

            obj.SetIncludeFile("MyExtension/myincludefile.js");

            obj.AddAction(...);
            obj.AddCondition(...);
            obj.AddExpression(...);

        }

        {
            gd::AutomatismMetadata & aut = AddAutomatism("AutomatismName",
                       _("Automatism name"),
                       "defaultGDname",
                       _("Description"),
                       "",

            automatismInfo.SetIncludeFile("MyExtension/myincludefile.js");

            aut.AddAction(...);
            aut.AddCondition(...);

 *
 * \section createNewExtension Create a new extension
 *
 * Creating a new extension can be made by following these steps :<br>
 *
 * -Copy the directory of an extension and rename it:
 * \image html images/createnew1.png
 * -Rename then the sources files :
 * \image html images/createnew2.png
 * -Open the Code::Blocks project.<br>
 * -Delete the non existing source files from the Code::Blocks project:
 * \image html images/createnew3.png
 * -Add then the recently renamed files ( Right click > Add files ):
 * \image html images/createnew4.png
 * -Rename the title of the project ( Project > Properties ) and modify the name of the output files ( Project > Properties > Build targets > Output filenames for each build targets ).
 * \image html images/createnew5.png
 * \image html images/createnew6.png
 * You can then start to modify the extension.<br>
 * <br>
 * You can compile your extension with the appropriate buttons:
 * \image html images/createnew7.png
 *
 * \section installExtension Use the extension with Game Develop
 *
 * To make your extension usable with %Game Develop, you have to:
 * -# <b>Copy the generated file</b> ( yourExtension.xgdw for example ) inside %Game Develop Js Platform "Extensions" folder. ( JsPlatform/Extensions/yourExtension.xgdw )<br>
 *  You can change the output directory in the Code::Blocks project to automatically create the extension file inside this folder.<br><br>
 * -# Copy <b>all needed include file</b> inside a folder with the name of your extension located in "JsPlatform/Runtime/Extensions" folder. ( JsPlatform/Runtime/Extensions/yourExtension/ )<br>
 *  You can use a <b>small script</b> ( batch file on Windows ) to copy all the needed includes files to this folder.<br><br>
 * -# <b>Translations catalog files</b> must be put into JsPlatform/Extensions/locale/<language>/yourExtension.mo ( Example : JsPlatform/Extensions/locale/fr_FR/yourExtension.mo )
