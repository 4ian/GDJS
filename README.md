Game Develop Javascript Platform
================================

Game Develop Javascript Platform ( GDJS ) is a platform for developing 
HTML5/Javascript based games with Game Develop 3 ( Free game development software 
available on http://www.compilgames.net ).

Download the Game Develop SDK
-----------------------------

To work or develop an extension for the JS Platform, you need to have the Game Develop SDK:
If it is not already done, just go on http://www.compilgames.net and download the SDK.

Then, extract it somewhere and put all the files from this repository in a folder 
called "GDJS", inside the Game Develop SDK folder.

If you want to work on official extensions, they are not directly shipped with the SDK, 
but are available on https://github.com/4ian/gd-extensions

Getting started
---------------

First, take a look at the documentation in the docs folder.
The project is mainly composed of two parts: The C++ part exposing the platform to Game
Develop ( Check the GDJS folder ) and the Javascript game engine ( Inside the Runtime folder ).
